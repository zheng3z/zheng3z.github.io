# How to Deploy

- Once you are done with your setup and have successfully completed all steps above, you need to put your website online!
- I highly recommend using [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to achieve this the EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, you have two options. First you need to create a github repository with the name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give it any other name.
- Now, you need to generate a production build and deploy the website.

**Option 1:**

- Run `npm run build` to generate the production build folder.
- Enter the build folder, `git init` and push the generated code to the `master` branch of your new repository. That's it. Done.
  You may need to `git init` and force push at every new build.

**Option 2 ^This deploy^ (will not work with [user pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)):**

- Run `npm install gh-pages --save-dev`. This package will help create a distributable version of the React app to a branch named `gh-pages`.
- Run `npm run deploy` to build and create branch `gh-pages`. It will push the `build` files to that branch.
- Then, [configure your GitHub page](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages#8-configure-github-pages).

Now, your website is successfully deployed and you can visit it at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.
